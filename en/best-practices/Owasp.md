# Open Web Application Security Project

## What is OWASP?

The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a global community dedicated to improving software security.

## OWASP Mission

The mission of OWASP is to help organizations develop, acquire, and maintain reliable and secure applications and APIs.

## OWASP Main Objectives

- **Education**: Provide educational resources on secure development practices.
- **Tools and Documentation**: Make tools and guides available to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Standards and Best Practices**: Define standards for secure software development.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Foster collaboration to address security challenges.

## OWASP Top 10 List

The OWASP Top 10 List is a frequently updated list of the top ten security vulnerabilities in web applications, reflecting current threats.

- **Injection**
    - **Description**: Vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject untrusted code into an application.
    - **Example**: SQL Injection: An attacker inserts malicious SQL commands into a form input, gaining unauthorized access to the database.

- **Broken Authentication**
    - **Description**: Failures in authentication mechanisms and session management.
    - **Example**: Insecure session management: Failure to properly invalidate or secure sessions after logout, allowing unauthorized access.

- **Sensitive Data Exposure**
    - **Description**: Exposure of sensitive information such as passwords or financial data.
    - **Example**: Storing passwords in plain text: Passwords stored without proper encryption, easily accessible by attackers.

- **XML External Entities (XXE)**
    - **Description**: Allows an attacker to insert malicious XML entities.
    - **Example**: XML Entity Inclusion Attacks: Inclusion of remote files or unauthorized access to system resources through XML entities.

- **Broken Access Control**
    - **Description**: Failures in restricting access to certain functionalities or resources.
    - **Example**: Direct access to restricted URLs: An unauthorized user directly accesses URLs that should be restricted to specific user profiles.

- **Security Misconfiguration**
    - **Description**: Inadequate security configurations or weak defaults.
    - **Example**: Unchanged default settings: Use of software default settings without changes, which may contain known vulnerabilities.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    - **Description**: Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    - **Example**: Reflected XSS: An attacker sends a malicious link that, when clicked, executes a script in the victim's browser.

- **Insecure Deserialization**
    - **Description**: Unsafe handling of serialized objects.
    - **Example**: Malicious deserialization: Manipulation of serialized objects to execute malicious code on the server.

- **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
    - **Description**: Using components with known security flaws.
    - **Example**: Using outdated libraries: Use of old versions of libraries with known vulnerabilities.

- **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
    - **Description**: Lack of proper activity logging and security monitoring.
    - **Example**: Lack of audit logs: Absence of system activity records, making it difficult to detect malicious activities.

## OWASP Projects and Tools

- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**
    - **Description**: A tool to find security vulnerabilities in web applications.
    - **Example**: Scanning a web application for flaws.

- **OWASP Dependency-Check**
    - **Description**: Identifies dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
    - **Example**: Checking project dependencies to identify vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

OWASP plays a crucial role in improving the security of web applications and software systems. Utilizing the guidelines, tools, and projects offered by OWASP can help protect applications against cyber threats.
