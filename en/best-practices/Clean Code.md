# Clean Code

## What is Clean Code?

Clean Code is the practice of writing readable, understandable, and simple code. This involves adopting good programming practices to create high-quality software. The goal is to produce code that not only works but is also easy to understand and maintain.

## Why is it important?

The practice of Clean Code is fundamental due to its ability to simplify software maintenance. By being clear and organized, it enables efficient bug identification and smooth incorporation of new features. Its benefits include:

- **Facilitated maintenance**: The clarity and organization of the code simplify error correction and implementation of improvements.
- **Effective bug identification**: Proper structuring helps in the quick detection and resolution of problems.
- **Easy addition of new features**: The comprehensibility of the code makes it easier to introduce new functionalities.
- **Long-term cost reduction**: Minimizes the need for rework and speeds up future development.

## Fundamental Principles

- Solid
- Dry
- Kiss

These principles are fundamental for writing clean and high-quality code, promoting software maintainability, extensibility, and readability.
We can also mention Yagni as a good practice.

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions

Naming conventions are rules that define how to name variables, functions, classes, and other code elements. They help standardize and make these elements more understandable. Some common examples are:

- Camel Case: Used for naming variables and functions. Example: variableName, functionName.
- Pascal Case: Used for naming classes and methods. Example: ClassName, MethodName.

### Proper Code Structuring

Organize code hierarchically, dividing it into smaller, logically separated parts such as modules, classes, and methods. This practice facilitates understanding the program flow and quickly locating specific functionalities.

### Size and Complexity

Keep functions and classes short and focused on specific tasks. Avoid long and complex methods, as they make the code harder to read and understand. Reducing complexity helps in maintenance and identifying potential errors.

### Comments and Documentation

Comments should be used to explain why a certain piece of code exists, especially in non-obvious situations. Documentation should focus on the intent behind the code, describing its purpose and context, not just repeating what the code does.

### Exception Handling

Adopt a consistent approach to exception handling. Use exceptions to handle exceptional situations and foresee appropriate behavior for these cases. Avoid catching generic exceptions that might hide errors and make debugging more complex.

## Best Practices

### Small and Specific Functions/Methods

Dividing the code into small, specific functions or methods helps keep the code concise and focused. Each function should have a single responsibility, performing a well-defined task. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each part of the code, making it more readable and easier to test.

### Avoid Duplicated Code

Avoiding code duplication is crucial for software maintenance and consistency. Identify repetitive patterns and abstract them into separate functions or modules, promoting code reuse. By consolidating similar logic, you reduce the amount of code to maintain and minimize the chances of inconsistencies.

### Unit Testing

Unit testing is essential to ensure that individual parts of the code work correctly. They validate small isolated units of the software, checking if each component performs its function as expected. These tests help detect and fix problems early, making the code more robust and reliable.

### Static Analysis Tools

Static analysis tools examine the code for issues, inconsistencies, and patterns that might compromise software quality. They check for issues such as cyclomatic complexity, coding standard compliance, potential security vulnerabilities, and development best practices.

## Refactoring

### Importance of Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It is essential to improve code quality over time, eliminating duplications, simplifying complex logic, and making the code more understandable. Continuous refactoring keeps the code up to date and facilitates the incorporation of new features.

### Refactoring Techniques

There are several refactoring techniques that can be applied to improve code quality:

- **Method/Function Extraction**: Identify duplicate code and extract it into separate functions or methods.
- **Condition Simplification**: Simplify complex conditional expressions to make the code more readable.
- **Variable/Method Renaming**: Rename variables, functions, or methods to make their purpose clearer.
- **Identifying Bad Code**: It is important to identify areas of the code that need refactoring. This can be done through code reviews, static analysis, or simply by observing parts of the code that are difficult to understand or modify. Poorly structured, complex, or hard-to-maintain code are good indicators that refactoring is needed.

### Strategies for Successful Refactoring

- **Small Steps**: Perform refactoring in small incremental steps to minimize the risk of introducing new bugs.
- **Maintain Automated Tests**: Ensure that the code's functionality is preserved after each refactoring through automated tests.
- **Share Knowledge**: Share code improvements through code reviews and team discussions to disseminate best practices.

## Communication and Collaboration

### Clear Communication in Code

Code should communicate its intent clearly and concisely. Writing readable and self-explanatory code is crucial to facilitate understanding by other developers. Meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes, along with a well-organized structure, are key aspects of effective communication in the source code.

### Teamwork and Collaborative Practices

Collaboration among team members is crucial for the success of a software project. Sharing knowledge, ideas, and solutions through meetings, discussion forums, or collaborative platforms strengthens collective development and results in more robust and well-thought-out solutions.

### Code Reviews and Constructive Feedback

Code reviews are valuable opportunities to identify possible improvements and errors in the code. Encouraging regular reviews among team members promotes an environment where knowledge is shared, and constructive feedback is provided to enhance code quality.

### Importance of Documentation

Besides the code itself, clear and detailed documentation is essential. It aids in understanding the purpose and functioning of the software. Documenting design decisions, code structure, functionalities, and installation or usage procedures is crucial to facilitate the maintenance and evolution of the project.

## Examples

**Note: Examples in Golang**

### Simple and Direct Syntax

Before:

```go
// Code with multiple nested conditions
func getType(i int) string {
    if i == 1 {
        return "one"
    } else {
        if i == 2 {
            return "two"
        } else {
            return "other"
        }
    }
}
```

After:

```go
// Using switch to simplify logic
func getType(i int) string {
    switch i {
    case 1:
        return "one"
    case 2:
        return "two"
    default:
        return "other"
    }
}

```

### Descriptive Naming Principle

Before:

```go
// Function with a non-descriptive name
func calc(x, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

After:

```go
// Function with a descriptive name
func sum(x, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

### Meaningful Comment

Before:

```go
// Function add: adds two numbers
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

```

After:

```go
// add returns the sum of two integers
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

### Small and Specific Functions

Before:

```go
func processOrder(order Order) {
    // Complex order processing logic
}
```

After:

```go
func validateOrder(order Order) error {
    // Logic to validate the order
    // Returns an error if validation fails
}

func calculateTotal(order Order) float64 {
    // Logic to calculate the order total
    // Returns the order total
}

func updateInventory(order Order) {
    // Logic to update inventory after the order is processed
}
```
